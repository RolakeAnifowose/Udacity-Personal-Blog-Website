                    Hi, I'm <i><strong>Anifowose Morolake</strong></i>, a frontend web developer based in Lagos,
                    Nigeria. Well, not yet a front-end developer, more of a Quality Assurance analyst for the time
                    being. I studied Computer Science but did not really have a clear cut path as to what I wanted to do
                    after university.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had course mates who started software development as early as 200 level, and while I dabbled into
                    it, I did not take it very seriously. I was a first class student, and the excuse I always gave
                    myself was that I did not want my grades to drop.
                </p>

                <p>I had a fascination with software development, my dad had a friend who was a software engineer, and
                    when he tried persuading me to consider tech, I said: <q>We'll see how that goes.</q></p>
