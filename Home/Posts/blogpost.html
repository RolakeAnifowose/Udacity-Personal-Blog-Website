                        Hi, I'm Anifowose Morolake, a frontend web developer based in Lagos, Nigeria. Well, not yet a front-end developer, more of a Quality Assurance analyst for the time being. I studied Computer Science but did not really have a clear cut path as to what I wanted to do after university.

                        I had course mates who started software development as early as 200 level, and while I dabbled into it, I did not take it very seriously. I was a first class student, and the excuse I always gave myself was that I did not want my grades to drop.
                    </p>

                    <p>I had a fascination with software development, my dad had a friend who was a software engineer,...</p>
