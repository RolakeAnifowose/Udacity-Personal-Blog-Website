                        <p>Hi, I'm Anifowose Morolake, a frontend web developer based in Lagos, Nigeria. Well, not yet a front-end developer, more of a Quality Assurance analyst for the time being. I studied Computer Science but did not really have a clear cut path as to what I wanted to do after university.
                        I had course mates who started software development as early as 200 level, and while I dabbled into it, I did not take it very seriously. I was a first class student...

                        <p>I graduated university in June, 2019. Had the best result in my faculty but I knew I wasn't prepared for the kind of job role I wanted. In my final year in school, one of my lecturers introduced us to Software Testing.
                        Prior to that I had no idea what it was, but I decided to give it a try, I took the classes, wrote my CTFL exam and passed it. I had officially become a certified software tester knowing fully well that when I got into the job market, I wouldn't want a job in Quality Assurance.
